description: A web application that generates Python functions for calculating partial
  derivatives of a given function with respect to specified parameters. It utilizes
  the SymPy library for symbolic differentiation on the backend and returns the text
  of Python functions that compute the derivatives. Users can input their function
  and parameters, and the app will generate and display the derivative functions,
  with an option to save the generated code for future use.
