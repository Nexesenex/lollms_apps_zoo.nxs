# Web App Name: FocusFlow - Procrastination Management Assistant

## User Requirements
The user needs a single-file web application that helps combat procrastination by organizing tasks, sending reminders, and minimizing distractions. The app should include features for task management, notifications, and focus-enhancing tools. It should be lightweight, efficient, and run entirely within a single HTML file using CSS and JavaScript. The app can utilize system notifications to remind the user of pending tasks.
