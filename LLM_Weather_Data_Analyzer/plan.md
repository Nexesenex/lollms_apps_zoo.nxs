Application Overview:
  The LLM-based Weather Data Aggregator is designed to collect, analyze, and present weather data from various predictive models. The application aims to provide users with a comprehensive view of weather forecasts by aggregating data from multiple sources and utilizing machine learning to enhance predictive accuracy.

Key Features:
  - Data Aggregation: Collect weather data from multiple predictive models and sources.
  - Data Analysis: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze and compare the accuracy of different models.
  - Visualization: Provide graphical representations of weather data and predictive accuracy.
  - Historical Data: Store and retrieve historical weather data for trend analysis.
  - User Dashboard: Customizable dashboard for users to view and interact with weather data.
  - Alerts and Notifications: Set up alerts for specific weather conditions or changes in predictive models.
  - API Access: Provide API endpoints for external applications to access aggregated weather data.

User Interface:
  - Dashboard: Main interface displaying aggregated weather data, visualizations, and alerts.
  - Data Visualization: Charts, graphs, and maps to represent weather data and model comparisons.
  - Settings: User preferences for data sources, alert configurations, and dashboard customization.
  - Historical Data: Interface for accessing and analyzing historical weather data.
  - API Documentation: Section providing details on how to use the API endpoints.

Data Model:
  - WeatherData: Stores raw weather data from various sources.
    - Fields: source, timestamp, temperature, humidity, wind_speed, precipitation, etc.
  - ModelAccuracy: Stores accuracy metrics for different predictive models.
    - Fields: model_name, timestamp, accuracy_score, etc.
  - UserPreferences: Stores user-specific settings and preferences.
    - Fields: user_id, preferred_sources, alert_settings, dashboard_layout, etc.
  - HistoricalData: Stores historical weather data for trend analysis.
    - Fields: date, temperature, humidity, wind_speed, precipitation, etc.

Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - Backend: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests and server-side logic.
  - Database: MongoDB for storing weather data, user preferences, and historical data.
  - Machine Learning: Python with scikit-learn for implementing predictive model analysis.
  - Additional Tools: D3.js for data visualization, Docker for containerization, and Nginx for load balancing.

Security Measures:
