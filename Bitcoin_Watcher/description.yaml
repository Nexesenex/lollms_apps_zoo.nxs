description: A standalone web UI for monitoring and analyzing Bitcoin. The application fetches and displays live Bitcoin market data from the CoinGecko API, including current price, 24-hour change, high/low, and market capitalization. It visualizes the last 90 days of price history in an interactive chart using Chart.js. The core feature is its integration with a user-configurable Lollms-compatible AI server. Users can request an AI-generated analysis of the current market conditions, which is then displayed in a clean, readable format. The entire application is contained within a single HTML file, featuring a responsive, modern dark-themed design. A settings modal allows users to specify their local Lollms instance URL, model name, and an optional API key for personalized AI analysis.
disclaimer: The AI-generated analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Market data is provided by a third-party API (CoinGecko) and may have delays or inaccuracies. Always conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.
