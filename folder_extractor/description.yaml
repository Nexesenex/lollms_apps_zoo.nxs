  An advanced web utility for developers and AI users to analyze and document codebases. It generates comprehensive Markdown from folder structures, including file content or code signatures.
  Key features include a project management dashboard for handling multiple projects, AI-powered file selection via integration with OpenAI-compatible LLMs (like lollms-chat) to suggest relevant files for development tasks, and enhanced tree regeneration options.
  The tool offers powerful filtering, customizable AI prompt templates, and a modern, persistent web interface, making it an essential assistant for context engineering, documentation, and streamlined development workflows.

  This application is provided "as-is." The accuracy of AI-suggested files depends on the configured LLM and the quality of the user's prompt. Users should review all selections and generated output. The developers are not responsible for any issues arising from the use of this tool.
