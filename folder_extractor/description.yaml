  Folder Structure to Text (Folder Extractor) is a comprehensive PyQt5 application designed to generate a Markdown-formatted text representation of a specified folder's structure and contents.
  It allows users to select a project folder, customize inclusion and exclusion rules (using presets, specific folder/file names, extensions, and glob patterns), and control aspects like maximum file size for content extraction.
  The tool is particularly useful for developers, technical writers, and AI users who need to create detailed project overviews, prepare context for Large Language Models (LLMs), or document codebases.
  It features a user-friendly interface with theme support, environment settings management (load/save configurations), integration of external documentation files into the output, and customizable AI prompt templates to streamline workflows.
disclaimer: |
  This application is provided "as-is" without any warranties. The accuracy and completeness of the generated output depend on the user's configuration and the nature of the scanned files.
  Users should review the output carefully, especially when used for critical documentation or as input for other systems. The developers are not responsible for any issues arising from the use of this tool.
