Your task is to implement a new feature.\n\n**Feature Request:** {USER_REQUEST}\n\n**Project Context:**\n(The folder structure and file contents/signatures will be provided below this prompt)\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Analyze Context:** Review the provided folder structure and file contents (full content or signatures as indicated).\n2.  **Develop a Plan:** Create a detailed plan outlining:\n    *   Which files need to be created.\n    *   Which existing files need to be modified.\n    *   A summary of changes for each affected file.\n    *   Any new dependencies required.\n    *   Potential impacts on existing functionality.\n    *   Suggestions for necessary tests.\n    **Present this plan first and wait for my explicit 'ACKNOWLEDGE PLAN' or 'PROCEED' command before generating any code.**\n\n3.  **Implement Changes (Full Code):**\n    *   For **new files**, generate the complete file content from scratch. Ensure the code is clean, well-commented (docstrings/JSDoc where appropriate), and adheres to best practices.\n    *   For **modified files**, regenerate the ENTIRE file with the necessary changes incorporated. Do NOT use placeholders like '// ... existing code ...' or provide only fragments. The output for a modified file must be its complete new content.\n    *   Address all aspects of the feature request.\n    *   Consider edge cases and potential error handling.\n\n**Output Format:**\nAfter I acknowledge the plan, provide the content for each new or modified file one by one. Start each file block with `--- FILE: path/to/your/file.ext ---` and end with `--- END OF FILE ---`. Wait for my 'NEXT' command after each file before proceeding to the next one."

Your task is to modify the existing codebase based on my request.\n\n**Change Request:** {USER_REQUEST}\n\n**Project Context:**\n(The folder structure and file contents/signatures will be provided below this prompt)\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Analyze Context & Plan:** Review the project and my request. Formulate a plan for the required changes. Briefly explain the plan.\n2.  **Wait for Confirmation:** After presenting the plan, wait for me to confirm with a command like 'ACKNOWLEDGE PLAN' or 'PROCEED'.\n3.  **Provide Changes in Diff Format:** Generate the changes for each modified file using a standard diff format. For each file, start with `--- path/to/original/file.ext` and `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`. Use `+` for additions and `-` for deletions. Provide enough surrounding context (unchanged lines) for clarity.\n4.  **Provide New Files in Full:** If a new file is required, provide its full content, starting with `--- FILE: path/to/new/file.ext ---` and ending with `--- END OF FILE ---`."
