description: The Comic Book Builder app is designed to streamline the process of creating
  comic book storyboards from user prompts. It utilizes Lollms to generate a detailed
  storyboard, synthesizes a list of required illustrations along with their sizes
  in JSON format, and then parses this JSON to create image placeholders. The app
  further employs Lollms for image generation to produce illustrations in the specified
  format. Finally, it integrates a backend service to stitch all generated images
  together and incorporates the text into a PowerPoint file created using Python,
  making comic book creation efficient and accessible.
