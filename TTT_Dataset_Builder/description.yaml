description: This application leverages lollms to generate a dataset for test-time
  training allowing trained language models to learn from examples at inference time.
  It uses code generation capabilities to create task prompts and corresponding solutions
  forming a database of test-time training entries. The generated dataset consists
  of task prompts providing example problem resolutions and asking the AI to solve
  similar problems using the same logic followed by the expected solution output.
  The application exports the dataset as a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries
  with task_prompt and task_process pairs.
