description: Chat with PDFs is an interactive application that allows users to engage
  in conversations with AI based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. The app
  features a central discussion area for seamless back-and-forth communication, with
  the AI impersonating the knowledge contained in the PDFs. User settings and information
  are stored discreetly in a popup overlay, accessible via a settings button. The
  application employs a sliding window mechanism to maintain short-term context during
  discussions, ensuring relevant and focused interactions.
disclaimer: This application is designed for educational and informational purposes
  only. The AI's responses are based solely on the content of the uploaded PDFs and
  should not be considered as professional advice or a substitute for expert consultation.
