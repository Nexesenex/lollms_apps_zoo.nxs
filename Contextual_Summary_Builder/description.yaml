description: This application is a powerful tool designed to generate contextual summaries
  from various document formats including PDF, DOCX, and TXT. Users can input a file
  and provide specific context or points of interest for the summary. The app then
  utilizes the task library to analyze the document content and create a tailored
  summary based on the given context. The output is presented as rendered markdown,
  allowing for easy reading and formatting. With localization support, copy functionality,
  and export options, this app streamlines the process of extracting relevant information
  from documents according to user-defined criteria.
