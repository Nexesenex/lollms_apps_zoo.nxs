description: XTTS Voice Uploader is a web application that enables users to record their
  voice or upload existing WAV files to a server. It provides a simple interface for
  capturing audio input directly through the browser or selecting a pre-recorded WAV
  file from the user's device. The application then securely transmits the audio data
  to the server using the /upload_voice endpoint, ensuring that only WAV files are
  accepted for upload. This tool is useful for various audio processing tasks, voice
  analysis, or creating voice-based content.
