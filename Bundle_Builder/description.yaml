description: A sleek web application that allows users to create custom JavaScript
  and CSS bundles. Users can input a list of JS and CSS links, specify a bundle name,
  add or remove links dynamically, and generate a single consolidated JS file and
  a single CSS file. The application uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design,
  providing an intuitive and efficient user experience for developers and web designers
  looking to optimize their asset management.
disclaimer: This application is for development purposes only. Users should ensure
  they have the necessary rights and permissions to bundle and use the specified external
  resources.
