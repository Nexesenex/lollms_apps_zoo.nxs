## Introduction

The Multi-Code Analysis Tool is a powerful web-based application designed to analyze, document, and refactor multiple code files simultaneously. It provides an intuitive interface for developers and technical writers to work with various programming languages, generate documentation, and improve code quality.

## Features

- Multi-language code editor with syntax highlighting
- Code analysis, documentation, and refactoring capabilities
- AI-powered processing using LOLLMS (Language Model as a Service)
- Project management (save, load, and create new projects)
- Customizable user settings
- Internationalization support (English, French, and Spanish)
- Markdown rendering for output
- Copy and save analysis results

## Installation

To set up the Multi-Code Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-code-analysis-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd multi-code-analysis-tool
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

Note: This tool requires an active internet connection to load external libraries and stylesheets.

## Usage

1. Open the tool in your web browser.
2. Use the "Add Code" button to create new code tabs.
3. Enter or load your code into the editor tabs.
4. Select the operation type (Analysis, Documentation, Refactoring, or Custom).
5. Enter your prompt in the "User Input" section.
6. Click the "Process" button to generate the analysis.
7. View the results in the "Output" section.
8. Copy or save the output as needed.

## Components

### 1. Code Editor

The tool uses Monaco Editor, providing a powerful code editing experience with features like:

- Syntax highlighting
- Multiple language support
- Tab management

```javascript
require(['vs/editor/editor.main'], function() {
    const editor = monaco.editor.create(editorContainer, {
        value: content,
        language: 'javascript',
        theme: 'vs-dark',
        automaticLayout: true
    });
    // ... (editor setup)
});
```

### 2. AI Processing

The tool leverages the LOLLMS client for AI-powered code analysis:

```javascript
const lc = new LollmsClient();
// ... (in the analyzeBtn event listener)
document_output = await lc.generate(lc.system_message() + systemPrompt + lc.template.separator_template + lc.user_message() + userPrompt + lc.template.separator_template + lc.ai_message());
```

### 3. Internationalization

The tool supports multiple languages using a custom WebAppLocalizer:

```javascript
const translations = {
    en: { /* English translations */ },
    fr: { /* French translations */ },
    es: { /* Spanish translations */ }
};
const localizer = new WebAppLocalizer(translations, 'multiCodeAnalysis_', document.getElementById('languageSelector'));
```

### 4. Markdown Rendering

Output is rendered as Markdown for better readability:

```javascript
const markdownRenderer = new MarkdownRenderer();
// ... (in the analyzeBtn event listener)
const renderedOutput = await markdownRenderer.renderMarkdown(document_output);
outputArea.innerHTML = renderedOutput;
```

## Customization

### User Settings

Users can customize their experience by setting their name, email, and additional information:

```javascript
let userSettings = {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    extraInfo: ''
};
```

### Operation Types

The tool supports various operation types:

- Analysis
- Documentation
- Refactoring
- Custom (user-defined)
