description: Text Shrinker is a web application designed to efficiently condense lengthy
  texts to a specified word count. Users input their original text along with a target
  word limit, and the application iteratively shrinks the content while preserving
  its core meaning. The process continues until the text meets or falls below the
  desired word count, ensuring concise and impactful communication.
