description: Document to Slides is a powerful web application that transforms various
  document formats into concise and visually appealing slides. It accepts input in
  multiple formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD, as well as direct text input
  from users. The application leverages Lollms generation capabilities to create slide
  content, including text and potential image placeholders. Users can control the
  number of output slides through a convenient settings popup, accessible via an SVG
  settings button located in the top right corner of the page. The interface is designed
  using the Lollms theme for a seamless user experience.
