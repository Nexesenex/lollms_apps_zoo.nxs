description: A comprehensive chicken breeding application that helps breeders track
  and predict offspring characteristics based on parent traits. The app uses AI to
  analyze breeding parameters and genetic traits to provide predictions with confidence
  levels. It features an intuitive user interface built with TailwindCSS allowing
  breeders to input parent characteristics, view predicted offspring traits, and maintain
  detailed breeding records. The AI-powered prediction system considers multiple traits
  including feather patterns, size, egg production, temperament, and health markers
  to generate accurate breeding forecasts.
disclaimer: The breeding predictions provided by this application are based on AI
  analysis and should be used as guidance only. Results may vary based on multiple
  genetic and environmental factors. Always consult with poultry breeding experts
  for critical breeding decisions.
