description: Colab2API is a powerful tool that transforms Google Colab notebooks into
  ready-to-deploy FastAPI endpoints. It automatically generates a requirements.txt
  file and a server.py script, encapsulating the core functionality of the notebook
  in a sleek FastAPI application. The tool also implements a modern TailwindCSS design
  for a polished user interface, making it easy to transition from experimentation
  to production-ready API services.
