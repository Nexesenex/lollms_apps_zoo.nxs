description: Talk to PDF is an innovative application that allows users to interact
  with PDF documents as if they were conversing with a knowledgeable entity. Users
  can upload PDF files and engage in a dynamic dialogue, asking questions about specific
  elements or requesting comprehensive summaries. The app leverages advanced AI technology
  for text generation and employs a smart decision-making process to determine whether
  to use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or summarization based on the user's
  input. With a user-friendly interface styled using Tailwind CSS, the app offers
  a seamless learning experience through conversation. It features customizable settings
  including AI personality tone, language preferences, and various LOLLMS parameters,
  all of which are persistently saved for user convenience.
