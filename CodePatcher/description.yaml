description: A simple desktop application built with PyQt5 that allows users to apply
  unified diff patch files (.diff, .patch) to original files. It provides a graphical
  interface to select the files, choose between modifying the original file in-place
  or saving the result to a new file, and applies the patch using the 'python-patch'
  library.
disclaimer: Applying patches, especially in-place, can lead to data loss if the patch
  file does not correctly match the original file or if the process is interrupted.
  Always back up important files before applying patches, particularly when modifying
  in-place. Success depends on the patch format and the state of the original file.
features:
- Graphical user interface using PyQt5.
- Browse and select the original file to be patched.
- Browse and select the patch file (.diff, .patch).
- Option to apply the patch directly to the original file (in-place modification).
- Option to save the patched result to a specified new file.
- Status bar providing feedback on operations and errors.
- Confirmation dialog before applying patches in-place to prevent accidental modification.
installation:
- Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- Install the required Python libraries using pip: pip install PyQt5 python-patch
- Save the application code as a Python file (e.g., `patch_app.py`).
- Run the application from the command line: python patch_app.py
