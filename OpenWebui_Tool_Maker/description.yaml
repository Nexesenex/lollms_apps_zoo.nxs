description: A specialized application that helps developers create OpenWebui tools
  by generating code based on prompts. The app leverages the lollms generateCode method
  to produce well-structured Python code for custom tools complete with type hints
  and Sphinx-style documentation. It simplifies the process of building OpenWebui
  extensions by automating the code generation while following best practices.
disclaimer: The generated code should be reviewed and tested before use in production
  environments. API keys and sensitive information should be properly secured.
