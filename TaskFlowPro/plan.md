- Chart.js or D3.js: For rendering flowcharts and Gantt diagrams

### Data Structures

#### Task Flowchart JSON Example
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "Project Name",
    "budget": 100000,
    "workPackages": [
      {
        "id": "WP1",
        "name": "Work Package 1",
        "collaborator": "John Doe",
        "budget": 30000,
        "tasks": [
          {
            "id": "T1.1",
            "name": "Task 1.1",
            "description": "Task description"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Budget allocation for WP1 seems unrealistic"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Gantt Diagram JSON Example
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "WP1",
      "name": "Work Package 1",
      "start": "2023-06-01",
      "end": "2023-07-15",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "id": "T1.1",
      "name": "Task 1.1",
      "start": "2023-06-01",
      "end": "2023-06-15",
      "dependencies": ["WP1"]
    }
  ],
  "criticalPath": ["WP1", "T1.1"]
}
```

### File Structure
- Single HTML file containing:
  - HTML structure
  - CSS styles (internal or using a framework like Bootstrap)
  - JavaScript code (including all functionality and API calls)

### API Integration
- Implement functions to interact with lollms APIs for file conversion and code generation
- Handle file uploads and conversions
- Integrate AI-generated content into the user interface

### Data Persistence
- Use localStorage or IndexedDB for client-side data storage
- Implement export and import functionality for project data

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the application is usable on various screen sizes
- Implement mobile-friendly interactions for touch devices
