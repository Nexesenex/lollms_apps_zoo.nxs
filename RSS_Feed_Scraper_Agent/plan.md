# RSS Feed Scraper Agent

## Web App Name
RSS News Assistant

## User Requirements
Create a web application that scrapes RSS feeds, displays the content, and integrates it with a chat interface for Lollms. The app should:
1. Allow users to input RSS feed URLs
2. Fetch RSS content from a server endpoint
3. Display formatted RSS content in a side panel
4. Provide a chat environment with Lollms in the main panel
5. Integrate RSS content into Lollms responses

## User Interface Elements
1. Header
   - App title: "RSS News Assistant"
2. Left Panel (RSS Feed Input and Display)
   - Text input for RSS feed URLs
   - "Add Feed" button
   - "Start Scraping" button
   - Scrollable feed content area
3. Right Panel (Chat Interface)
   - Chat message display area
   - Text input for user messages
   - "Send" button

## Use Cases
1. Adding RSS Feeds
   - User enters RSS feed URL in the input field
   - User clicks "Add Feed" button
   - URL is added to the list of feeds to scrape

2. Scraping RSS Feeds
   - User clicks "Start Scraping" button
   - App sends request to server endpoint
   - App receives JSON response with feed content

3. Displaying RSS Content
   - App formats received RSS content
   - Formatted content is displayed in the left panel

4. Chatting with Lollms
   - User types message in chat input
   - User clicks "Send" button
   - Message is displayed in chat area
   - Lollms processes message and generates response
   - Response is displayed in chat area

5. Integrating RSS Content in Lollms Responses
   - Lollms references relevant RSS content in its responses
   - App highlights referenced content in the left panel

## Technical Considerations
1. Single HTML file structure
   - HTML for layout and structure
   - CSS for styling (internal `<style>` tag)
   - JavaScript for functionality (internal `<script>` tag)

2. Server Communication
   - Use `fetch` API to send POST requests to `localhost:8000/get_rss_content`
   - Handle JSON responses from the server

3. Dynamic Content Update
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM for RSS content and chat messages

4. Lollms Integration
   - Implement a function to send user messages to Lollms
   - Process Lollms responses and display them in the chat area
   - Develop a system to reference RSS content in Lollms prompts and responses
