description: A powerful, single-file HTML application for comprehensive grade management
  and analysis. GradeWise allows users to manage multiple projects, each with its
  own set of grades. It features full CRUD functionality for projects and grades,
  an interactive histogram for visualizing grade distribution, and a detailed statistical
  analysis including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. All data, including
  projects, grades, and settings, is persistently stored in the browser's local storage.
  The application is localized for seven languages (English, French, Arabic, Chinese,
  Italian, German, and Spanish) and is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive
  user experience.
