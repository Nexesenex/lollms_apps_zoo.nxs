description: A fully-fledged Calendar Application designed to be slick and modern.
  This application allows users to store calendar events and set alerts for upcoming
  events. Users can view their calendar and events by day, week, or month. The application
  features a custom interface for adding events, enhanced with Tailwind CSS for styling.
  Users can change the theme of the application, with the selected theme stored in
  local storage, prefixed with "calendar". In dark theme mode, the text color changes
  to white for improved contrast.
