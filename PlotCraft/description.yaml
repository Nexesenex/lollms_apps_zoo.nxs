description: PlotCraft is an interactive web application that leverages the power
  of natural language processing and data visualization. It allows users to generate
  matplotlib plots using simple text prompts. The application utilizes Lollms generateCode
  functionality to convert user prompts into Python code, which is then executed on
  the backend to create custom plots. The resulting images are seamlessly displayed
  in the frontend, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating
  data visualizations without the need for manual coding.
