description: AI Vet Companion is an intelligent animal healthcare application that leverages
  the power of AI to provide personalized veterinary consultations. The app uses lollms
  as a virtual veterinarian, engaging pet owners in a series of questions about their
  animal's symptoms and health status. It also integrates with sensor data for a more
  comprehensive assessment. The AI analyzes responses and sensor inputs, visualizes
  its reasoning process using Mermaid diagrams, and ultimately provides a detailed
  diagnosis along with tailored pet health advice. To ensure continuity of care, the
  app stores pet information locally, allowing for informed follow-ups and progress
  tracking. Users can also export their pet's health data for personal records or
  import previous data for continued care.
disclaimer: This application is designed for informational purposes only and should
  not replace professional veterinary advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult
  with a qualified veterinarian for pet health concerns. In case of emergency, contact
  your local veterinary emergency services immediately.
