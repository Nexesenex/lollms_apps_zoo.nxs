  The Lollms Prompt Crafter is an engaging web application designed to streamline the creation, testing, and management of prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). 
  Users can dynamically build prompts by selecting or adding components from categories such as Subjects, Tasks, and specific Tests (e.g., testing coding style, SVG generation, MIDI composition, mathematical problem-solving, or alignment). 
  The application allows for the combination of these elements into a cohesive prompt.
  It leverages `lollms_client` to directly interact with an LLM (via a configured lollms service) for immediate prompt testing and feedback. 
  Generated prompts, along with their constituent components (subject, task, test), are stored in a `safe_store` database, facilitating future search, retrieval, and analysis. 
  This tool is ideal for prompt engineers, researchers, and developers looking to systematically explore and evaluate LLM capabilities across a diverse range of challenges.
disclaimer: |
  The effectiveness of generated prompts and LLM responses depends heavily on the underlying LLM's capabilities and configuration. 
  The quality of stored prompts is user-dependent. 
  Ensure your lollms service and `safe_store` are properly configured.
