CSS and JavaScript Considerations:
- Implement CSS animations for UI element distortions
- Use JavaScript for dynamic color changes and shape morphing
- Create event listeners for user interactions with weird effects
- Implement text scrambling and unscrambling animations
- Use Web Audio API for generating strange sound effects
- Incorporate SVG animations for abstract shape transformations
- Implement particle systems for background effects
- Use CSS filters for visual distortions on user input

AI Behavior:
- Instruct AI to prioritize imagination over factual accuracy
- Encourage the use of vivid, surreal imagery in responses
- Implement a "weirdness" slider to adjust hallucination intensity
- Program the AI to occasionally interrupt with random, unrelated thoughts
- Include a "reality anchor" feature to gradually return to normal conversation
