description: This application allows users to input a link to a GitHub page, which
  is then processed by Lollms to generate the necessary Docker code. The application
  extracts Docker code blocks and saves them as a downloadable blob in the form of
  a zip file containing the generated Docker files. Users can view the content of
  each file, and the application ensures that the files are named appropriately based
  on their types, such as Dockerfile and docker_compose. The process involves sending
  the GitHub text to Lollms, generating the required Docker files, and packaging them
  for easy download.
