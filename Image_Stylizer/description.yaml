description: Portrait Stylizer is a web application that allows users to upload a portrait image and transform it into an artistic style. Users can either specify a style through a text prompt (e.g., "in the style of Van Gogh") or provide a reference style image. Powered by Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, the application processes the image on a FastAPI server and displays the stylized result in an interactive web UI, offering a seamless way to create personalized artwork.
disclaimer: This application requires significant computational resources (preferably a GPU) for optimal performance. Results may vary depending on input quality and style complexity.
