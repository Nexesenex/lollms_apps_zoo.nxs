  Docxify is a lightweight yet powerful web application that transforms Markdown documents into professional Word (.docx) files.  
  Built with FastAPI for the backend and TailwindCSS for a clean, modern frontend, Docxify allows users to either upload Markdown files or paste raw Markdown text and instantly download a fully formatted DOCX.  
  It supports headings, lists, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, images, and hyperlinks, ensuring that your Markdown is faithfully converted into a polished Word document ready for professional or academic use.  
  With optional parameters for host and port configuration, Docxify can be easily deployed locally or on servers, making it a versatile tool for both personal writers and teams.  

disclaimer: |
  Docxify is designed to simplify Markdown-to-Word conversions and is intended for productivity and content creation purposes.  
  While it aims to produce high-quality DOCX documents, users should always review the output before using it in formal or professional contexts.  
  The developers are not responsible for formatting inconsistencies that may arise from complex Markdown or Word-specific requirements.
