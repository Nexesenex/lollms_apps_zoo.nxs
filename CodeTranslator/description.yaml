description: CodeTranslator is a powerful web application that allows users to effortlessly
  translate code from one programming language to another. With a user-friendly interface
  featuring a VSCode-like editor, users can input their code, select the source and
  target languages, and initiate the translation process with a single click. The
  application utilizes the Lollms client generateCode function to perform accurate
  code conversions. The translated code is displayed in a separate VSCode-like editor,
  complete with save and copy functionality for convenience. A loading spinner ensures
  users are informed of the ongoing translation process.
