description: This application leverages AI to generate dynamic PowerPoint presentations
  based on user prompts. It uses LoLLMs to create structured content and integrates
  AI image generation capabilities. Users can input text prompts to generate slide
  content and request AI-generated images or upload their own images for each slide.
  The app streamlines the process of creating engaging presentations by combining
  natural language processing with advanced visualization techniques.
