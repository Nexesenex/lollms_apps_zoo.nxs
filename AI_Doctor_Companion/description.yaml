description: AI Doctor Companion is an intelligent healthcare application that leverages
  the power of AI to provide personalized medical consultations. The app uses lollms
  as a virtual doctor, engaging users in a series of questions about their symptoms
  and health status. It also integrates with sensor data for a more comprehensive
  assessment. The AI analyzes responses and sensor inputs, visualizes its reasoning
  process using Mermaid diagrams, and ultimately provides a detailed diagnosis along
  with tailored health advice. To ensure continuity of care, the app stores user information
  locally, allowing for informed follow-ups and progress tracking. Users can also
  export their health data for personal records or import previous data for continued
  care.
disclaimer: This application is designed for informational purposes only and should
  not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult
  with a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns. In case of emergency,
  contact your local emergency services immediately.
