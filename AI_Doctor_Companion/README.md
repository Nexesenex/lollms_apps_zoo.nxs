# AI Doctor Companion

AI Doctor Companion is an intelligent healthcare application that leverages the power of AI to provide personalized medical consultations. The app uses lollms as a virtual doctor, engaging users in a series of questions about their symptoms and health status. It also integrates with sensor data for a more comprehensive assessment. The AI analyzes responses and sensor inputs, visualizes its reasoning process using Mermaid diagrams, and ultimately provides a detailed diagnosis along with tailored health advice. To ensure continuity of care, the app stores user information locally, allowing for informed follow-ups and progress tracking. Users can also export their health data for personal records or import previous data for continued care.
