Application Overview:
  - Purpose: The application is designed to generate Docker files from install scripts. It leverages Lollms to read and interpret these scripts, providing users with a seamless way to create Docker files tailored to their specific needs.
  - Main Features: Script interpretation, Docker file generation, user-friendly interface for script input and Docker file output.

Key Features:
  - Script Interpretation: Utilizes Lollms to read and understand install scripts, identifying necessary components and configurations.
  - Docker File Generation: Automatically generates Docker files based on the interpreted scripts, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.
  - User Input Interface: Allows users to input install scripts easily.
  - Output Management: Provides users with downloadable Docker files.
  - Error Handling: Identifies and reports errors in scripts, offering suggestions for corrections.

User Interface:
  - Components: 
    - Script Input Area: Text box for users to paste or type install scripts.
    - Output Display: Section to show generated Docker files.
    - Error Notification: Alerts for script errors with suggestions.
  - Layout: 
    - Clean and minimalistic design with a focus on usability.
    - Clear separation between input and output sections.
  - User Interactions:
    - Real-time script validation and feedback.
    - Download button for Docker files.

Data Model:
  - Data Structures: 
    - Script Data: Stores user input scripts.
    - Docker File Data: Stores generated Docker files.
  - Relationships: One-to-one relationship between script data and Docker file data.
  - Storage Requirements: Minimal storage for temporary data processing, primarily in-memory.

Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - Backend: Node.js with Express for handling script processing and Docker file generation.
  - Database: NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing user sessions and temporary data.
  - Additional Tools: Docker API for file generation, Lollms for script interpretation.

Security Measures:
  - Input Validation: Ensures scripts are safe and free from malicious code.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypts user data during transmission.
  - Access Control: Implements user authentication and authorization.

Scalability Design:
  - Microservices Architecture: Allows independent scaling of script processing and Docker file generation services.
  - Load Balancing: Distributes incoming requests evenly across servers.
  - Caching: Utilizes caching mechanisms to reduce load times and server strain.

Accessibility Considerations:
  - Keyboard Navigation: Ensures all functionalities are accessible via keyboard.
