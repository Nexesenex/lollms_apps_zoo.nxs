description: Image Cropper Pro is a powerful web application that allows users to
  crop images with a movable rectangle that defines the cropping area. Users can easily
  adjust the aspect ratio, zoom in and out using buttons or the mouse wheel, and pan
  the cropping rectangle to select the desired section of the image. The application
  features a container that ensures the previewed image never overflows, providing
  scrollbars when necessary. This tool is ideal for both casual users and professionals
  who require precise image editing capabilities in a user-friendly interface.
