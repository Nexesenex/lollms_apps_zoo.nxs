description: AI Electrician Companion is an intelligent application that leverages
  the power of AI to provide personalized electrical consultations and assistance.
  The app uses lollms as a virtual electrician, engaging users in a series of questions
  about their electrical issues, home wiring, and safety concerns. It can also integrate
  with smart home sensors for a more comprehensive assessment. The AI analyzes responses
  and sensor inputs, visualizes its reasoning process using Mermaid diagrams, and ultimately
  provides detailed diagnostics along with tailored electrical advice and solutions.
  To ensure continuity of service, the app stores information about the user's electrical
  setup locally, allowing for informed follow-ups and progress tracking. Users can also
  export their electrical data for personal records or import previous data for continued
  assistance.
disclaimer: This application is designed for informational purposes only and should
  not replace professional electrical advice, diagnosis, or repair. Always consult
  with a qualified, licensed electrician for electrical concerns. In case of emergency
  or immediate safety risks, contact your local emergency services or power company
  immediately.
