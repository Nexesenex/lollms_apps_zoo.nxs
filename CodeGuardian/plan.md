# Code Sanitizer App

## App Overview
A comprehensive code sanitization tool for analyzing code vulnerabilities and generating detailed security reports.

## User Requirements
- Accept code input from multiple sources: VSCode element, single file, or multiple files
- Process and analyze each file for potential vulnerabilities
- Implement an AI-driven reflection process for code evaluation
- Generate a detailed security report in Huntr.com style
- Display the entire analysis process to the user

## User Interface Elements
1. Input Section
   - Text area for pasting code
   - File upload button for single file
   - Multiple file upload functionality
   - VSCode-style code editor integration

2. Analysis Controls
   - "Analyze" button to initiate the process
   - Progress indicator

3. Results Display
   - Collapsible sections for each analyzed file
   - Vulnerability summary
   - Detailed AI reflection process
   - Huntr.com style report section

4. Export Options
   - Button to download the full report

## Use Cases
1. Paste Code Analysis
   - User pastes code into the text area
   - Clicks "Analyze"
   - Views the results and AI reflection process

2. Single File Analysis
   - User uploads a single file
   - System processes the file
   - Displays results and vulnerability report

3. Multiple File Analysis
   - User selects multiple files for upload
   - System analyzes each file separately
   - Presents a comprehensive report for all files

4. VSCode Integration
   - User inputs code via VSCode element
   - Initiates analysis
   - Reviews results within the app interface

## Technical Considerations
- Implement the entire app in a single HTML file
- Use embedded CSS for styling
- Utilize JavaScript for functionality and AI processing
- Incorporate a markdown parser for report generation
- Implement a code highlighting library for better code display

## AI Reflection Process
1. Question Generation
   - AI formulates relevant security questions about the code

2. Self-Analysis
   - AI answers its own questions based on code examination

3. Decision Making
   - AI makes security assessments within plaintext markdown tags

4. Vulnerability Identification
   - AI highlights and explains potential security issues

5. Report Compilation
   - AI generates a comprehensive Huntr.com style security report

## Report Structure
1. Executive Summary
2. Vulnerability Overview
3. Detailed Findings
   - For each vulnerability:
     - Description
     - Severity
     - Affected Components
     - Potential Impact
     - Recommended Fix
4. Code Snippets and Analysis
5. AI Reflection Process Insights
