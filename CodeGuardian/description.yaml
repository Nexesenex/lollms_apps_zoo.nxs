description: CodeGuardian is a powerful code sanitizer application designed to enhance
  software security. It accepts input from various sources including VSCode elements,
  individual files, or multiple files. The app employs advanced AI-driven analysis
  to thoroughly examine each piece of code for potential vulnerabilities. Using a
  unique reflection process, the AI interrogates the code, asking critical questions
  to uncover hidden weaknesses. The results are then presented in a comprehensive,
  Huntr.com-style report, providing developers with clear insights into potential
  security risks and suggested improvements. CodeGuardian serves as an essential tool
  for maintaining code integrity and bolstering overall application security.
