# System Task Analyzer

## Application Requirements
- List all running applications and processes on the current system
- Utilize Lollms to analyze the task list for potential security threats
- Identify suspicious tasks such as spyware, malware, keyloggers, etc.
- Present findings in a clear and user-friendly interface

## User Interface Elements
- Header with application title and brief description
- Task list display area
- Refresh button to update the task list
- Analysis results section
- Threat level indicators (e.g., safe, suspicious, dangerous)
- Detailed information panel for selected tasks

## Use Cases
1. View Running Tasks
   - User opens the application
   - System retrieves and displays current running tasks
   
2. Refresh Task List
   - User clicks the refresh button
   - Application updates the task list with current running processes

3. Analyze Tasks
   - User initiates analysis
   - Lollms processes the task list to identify potential threats
   - Results are displayed with threat levels and descriptions

4. View Detailed Task Information
   - User selects a specific task from the list
   - Detailed information about the task is displayed in the info panel

5. Handle Suspicious Tasks
   - User is alerted to suspicious tasks identified by Lollms
   - Options to research or terminate suspicious processes are provided

## Implementation Plan
1. HTML Structure
   - Create the basic layout for the single-page application
   - Include placeholders for task list, analysis results, and detailed info

2. CSS Styling
   - Design a clean and intuitive interface
   - Use color coding for threat levels (e.g., green for safe, yellow for suspicious, red for dangerous)

3. JavaScript Functionality
   - Implement task list retrieval and display
   - Create refresh mechanism for updating the task list
   - Integrate Lollms API for task analysis
   - Develop logic for displaying analysis results and detailed task information

4. Lollms Integration
   - Set up communication with Lollms API
   - Define parameters for threat identification
   - Process Lollms output and map to user-friendly descriptions

5. Security Considerations
   - Implement proper error handling and input validation
   - Ensure secure communication with system APIs and Lollms

6. Testing and Refinement
   - Test the application on various systems and scenarios
   - Refine threat detection accuracy and user interface based on feedback
