description: RoboMaze Navigator is an engaging educational game that teaches programming
  concepts through robot motion. Players use directional arrows to build a sequence
  of commands, guiding a robot through increasingly complex mazes. The grid-based
  levels feature various terrain types, including safe green roads and hazardous water
  and fire cells. Successfully navigating the robot to the objective earns points,
  with the difficulty ramping up over time. A leaderboard adds a competitive element,
  encouraging players to optimize their solutions and climb the ranks.
