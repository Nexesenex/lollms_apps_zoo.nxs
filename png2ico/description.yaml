description: The Enhanced PNG to ICO Converter is a client-side web application designed for easy conversion of PNG images into ICO (icon) files. Users can upload or drag-and-drop a PNG file, select a desired ICO size (e.g., 16x16, 32x32, up to 256x256 pixels), and the application will resize the image to generate a downloadable .ico file. It features an image preview of the resized output before download, a loading indicator during conversion, and intelligently uses the original PNG's filename for the downloaded ICO. The interface is built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience, requiring no server-side processing.
disclaimer: The ICO generation relies on the browser's canvas `toBlob('image/x-icon')` functionality, which typically creates single-image ICO files. For multi-resolution ICOs, specialized tools might be needed. Conversion quality depends on the input image and selected output size.
