description: LLM Data Synthesizer is a powerful tool for generating structured databases
  from various document formats. Users can upload PDF, TXT, DOCX, and other file types,
  which are then processed using advanced language models to create a comprehensive
  question-answer database. The app automatically generates relevant questions for
  each document, produces detailed answers, and compiles everything into a JSON format.
  With features like database export and direct updates to Hugging Face, this app
  streamlines the process of creating high-quality training data for language models.
