# Audio Cutter Web Application

## Application Overview

Audio Cutter is a single-file web application that allows users to upload, visualize, edit, and save audio files in WAV format. The application provides a timeline interface for precise audio cutting and manipulation.

## User Requirements

1. Upload and process WAV audio files
2. Display audio waveform on a zoomable timeline
3. Cut audio into multiple segments
4. Implement undo functionality for editing actions
5. Save individual audio segments as separate WAV files

## User Interface Elements

1. Header
   - Application title
   - Upload button

2. Main Content Area
   - Audio waveform display
   - Timeline with zoom controls
   - Playback controls (play, pause, stop)
   - Cutting tool

3. Sidebar
   - List of created audio segments
   - Undo button
   - Save button for each segment

4. Footer
   - Application information
   - Credits

## Use Cases

1. Upload Audio File
   - User clicks the upload button
   - File explorer opens for WAV file selection
   - Selected file is processed and displayed on the timeline

2. Zoom Timeline
   - User interacts with zoom controls
   - Timeline adjusts to show more or less detail of the waveform

3. Cut Audio
   - User selects cutting tool
   - User clicks on timeline to set cut points
   - Application creates new audio segments

4. Undo Action
   - User clicks undo button
   - Last editing action is reversed

5. Save Audio Segment
   - User selects a segment from the sidebar
   - User clicks the save button for that segment
   - Browser initiates download of the segment as a WAV file

## Technical Considerations

1. Audio Processing
   - Use Web Audio API for audio manipulation and visualization

2. File Handling
   - Implement FileReader API for uploading WAV files
   - Use Blob API for saving audio segments

3. Visualization
   - Utilize HTML5 Canvas for drawing the audio waveform

4. User Interface
   - Implement responsive design using CSS Flexbox or Grid
   - Use CSS transitions for smooth UI interactions

5. State Management
   - Maintain application state in JavaScript for undo functionality

6. Libraries
   - Consider using wavesurfer.js for advanced audio visualization and manipulation

## Code Structure

1. HTML structure for UI elements
2. CSS styles for layout and appearance
3. JavaScript modules
   - Audio processing and visualization
   - Timeline and zoom functionality
   - Cutting and segmentation logic
   - Undo system
   - File saving mechanism

## Performance Considerations

1. Optimize waveform rendering for large audio files
2. Implement efficient audio data structures for quick manipulation
3. Use Web Workers for heavy computational tasks to prevent UI blocking
