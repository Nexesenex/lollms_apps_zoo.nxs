Application Overview:
  The Documentation Building App is designed to generate comprehensive documentation from a given text or code file. It leverages the Lollms system to analyze the input and produce detailed documentation without any additional commentary or extraneous information. The application aims to provide a slick and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to obtain high-quality documentation efficiently.

Key Features:
  - File Input: Users can upload text or code files for documentation generation.
  - Documentation Generation: Utilizes Lollms to create detailed documentation from the input file.
  - Intuitive Interface: Designed for ease of use with minimal user interaction required.
  - Downloadable Output: Users can download the generated documentation in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
  - Version Control: Keeps track of different versions of the documentation for comparison and retrieval.

User Interface:
  - Upload Section: A drag-and-drop area for users to upload their files.
  - Progress Indicator: Displays the status of the documentation generation process.
  - Documentation Viewer: Allows users to preview the generated documentation before downloading.
  - Download Button: Provides options for downloading the documentation in different formats.
  - Navigation Bar: Includes links to user settings, help, and support.

Data Model:
  - File Metadata: Stores information about uploaded files, such as file name, type, and upload date.
  - Documentation Data: Contains the generated documentation content and associated metadata.
  - User Data: Manages user profiles, preferences, and version history.

Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: React.js for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
  - Backend: Node.js with Express.js for handling file uploads and processing requests.
  - Database: MongoDB for storing user data, file metadata, and documentation content.
  - Additional Tools: Lollms for documentation generation, AWS S3 for file storage.

Security Measures:
  - Authentication: Implement user authentication using OAuth 2.0.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
  - Access Control: Role-based access control to manage user permissions.
  - Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify vulnerabilities.

Scalability Design:
  - Microservices Architecture: Use microservices to handle different components of the application independently.
  - Load Balancing: Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
  - Auto-scaling: Utilize cloud services to automatically scale resources based on demand.

Accessibility Considerations:
  - Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all functionalities are accessible via keyboard
