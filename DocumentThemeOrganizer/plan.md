# Document Theme Sorter

## Application Overview

A web application that utilizes Lollms capabilities to sort documents into hierarchical themes, extracting keywords and building a structured tree representation.

## User Requirements

- Sort documents into themes, subthemes, and sub-subthemes
- Extract keywords from each document using Lollms task library summary capabilities
- Generate a hierarchical JSON structure of themes and documents
- Display the organized document structure to the user

## User Interface Elements

- Document upload area
- Progress indicator for processing
- Expandable/collapsible tree view for displaying the theme hierarchy
- Search functionality to find specific documents or themes
- Export option for the generated theme structure

## Use Cases

1. Upload Documents
   - User selects multiple documents for upload
   - System confirms successful upload

2. Process Documents
   - System extracts keywords from each document
   - Progress bar indicates processing status

3. Generate Theme Structure
   - System uses Lollms to create a hierarchical theme structure
   - HJSON tree is generated based on document keywords

4. Display Results
   - Tree view shows themes, subthemes, and documents
   - User can expand/collapse nodes to explore the structure

5. Search and Filter
   - User can search for specific documents or themes
   - Results are highlighted in the tree view

6. Export Theme Structure
   - User can export the generated structure as JSON or HJSON

## Technical Considerations

- Use HTML5 File API for document uploads
- Implement asynchronous processing to handle multiple documents
- Utilize Lollms task library for keyword extraction and theme generation
- Use a JavaScript library like jsTree for rendering the hierarchical view
- Implement client-side search functionality
- Use Web Workers for background processing if available
