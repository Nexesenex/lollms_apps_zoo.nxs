description: DocumentThemeOrganizer is a powerful application that leverages lollms
  capabilities to intelligently sort and organize documents into hierarchical themes.
  It utilizes the task library summary features to extract key information from each
  document, generating JSON-formatted keywords. The application then employs lollms
  to construct an HJSON tree structure based on these insights, presenting users with
  a clear and intuitive representation of their document collection organized by themes,
  subthemes, and further subdivisions. This tool streamlines document management,
  enhances content discovery, and provides valuable insights into document relationships
  and thematic structures.
