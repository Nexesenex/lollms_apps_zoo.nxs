description: An engaging space-themed incremental idle game where players build and
  manage their own galactic empire. Players start with basic resources like crystals
  and fuel, gradually automating operations through buildings and upgrades. The game
  features ship production, research trees, alien encounters, and empire management.
  Players can progress even when offline, unlock new technologies, engage in diplomacy
  or combat with alien species, and compete on global leaderboards. The game combines
  strategic decision-making with idle mechanics to create an addictive gameplay loop
  that rewards both active and passive play styles.
disclaimer: This game may include optional in-app purchases and online multiplayer
  features. Internet connection required for certain features. Player progress and
  game balance may be adjusted during development.
