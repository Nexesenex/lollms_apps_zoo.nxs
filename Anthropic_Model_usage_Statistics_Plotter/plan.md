# CSV Analytics Visualizer

## User Requirements
Create a single-file web application that allows users to upload a CSV file containing usage data and generate various statistical plots based on the file contents. The CSV file includes columns for usage date, model version, API key, workspace, usage type, and token usage metrics.

## User Interface Elements
1. File Upload Section
   - File input button for CSV selection
   - Upload button to process the file
2. Data Summary Section
   - Display basic statistics of the uploaded data
3. Chart Selection Area
   - Dropdown menu to choose different chart types
4. Visualization Area
   - Canvas or div element to render charts
5. Export Options
   - Buttons to export charts as images or data as JSON

## Use Cases
1. Upload CSV File
   - User selects and uploads the CSV file
   - System parses the file and stores data in memory
2. Generate Data Summary
   - Display total records, date range, unique model versions, workspaces, and usage types
3. Create Time Series Chart
   - Plot token usage over time for input and output tokens
4. Generate Model Version Comparison
   - Bar chart comparing token usage across different model versions
5. Visualize Workspace Usage
   - Pie chart showing distribution of usage across workspaces
6. Analyze Usage Types
   - Stacked bar chart of usage types over time or by workspace
7. Export Visualizations
   - Allow users to download charts as PNG images
8. Export Processed Data
   - Provide option to export analyzed data as JSON

## Technical Considerations
- Use HTML5 File API for file uploading
- Utilize Papa Parse library for CSV parsing
- Implement Chart.js for creating interactive charts
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) for data processing and manipulation
- Employ CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout
- Implement client-side data caching using localStorage or IndexedDB

## Code Structure
1. HTML Structure
   - Define layout and placeholder elements
2. CSS Styling
   - Create responsive and visually appealing design
3. JavaScript Modules
   - File handling and parsing
   - Data processing and analysis
