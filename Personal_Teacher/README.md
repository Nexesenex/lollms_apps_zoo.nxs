            Personal Teacher is an interactive learning application that leverages AI to provide personalized educational experiences. Users can express their desire to learn any subject, and the app will generate a comprehensive course with clear sections in markdown format. It then creates a demo, extracts the code using the tasks library, and presents it with HTML output. The application also saves course content for future reference, allowing users to build a personal library of learning materials.
