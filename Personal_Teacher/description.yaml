description: Personal Teacher is an interactive learning application that leverages
  AI to provide personalized educational experiences. Users can express their desire
  to learn any subject, and the app will generate a comprehensive course with clear
  sections in markdown format. It then creates a demo, extracts the code using the
  tasks library, and presents it with HTML output. The application also saves course
  content for future reference, allowing users to build a personal library of learning
  materials.
