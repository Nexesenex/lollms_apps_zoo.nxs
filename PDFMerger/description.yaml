description: A FastAPI-based web application designed to merge multiple PDF files
  into a single document. The PDF Fusion Tool features an intuitive drag-and-drop
  interface that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and arrange them in the
  desired order. Users can reorder PDFs using drag-and-drop functionality or arrow
  buttons, remove individual files before merging, and download the concatenated
  result with a single click. The application provides real-time validation, ensures
  only PDF files are accepted, and features a modern, responsive UI with smooth
  animations and visual feedback for all user actions.
