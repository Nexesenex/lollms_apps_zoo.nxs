# Article Reviewer Web Application

## Overview

The Article Reviewer is a web-based application that allows users to upload various document types (PDF, TXT, MD, LaTeX, DOCX) and generate an AI-powered review of the content. The application uses the Lollms client library for text generation and various other libraries for file processing and markdown rendering.

## Features

- Web App Localizer
- Mammoth.js (for DOCX processing)
- PDF.js
- PPTX2JSON
- Highlight.js
- MathJax
- Mermaid
- Anime.js
- Prism.js
- KaTeX

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application structure and scripts

## HTML Structure

The `index.html` file contains the following main sections:
