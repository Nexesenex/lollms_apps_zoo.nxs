3. Allow users to input custom character descriptions

## Technical Considerations
1. HTML Structure

   - Semantic HTML5 tags for improved accessibility

   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Custom styles for ID card layout and artistic effects
   - Animation effects for a more dynamic user experience
3. JavaScript Functionality
   - Integration with Lollms's `generateCode` method for character generation
   - Dynamic updating of the ID card display
   - Implementation of art style filters and effects
   - JSON parsing and stringifying for data handling
4. External Libraries (if needed)
   - Consider using a lightweight CSS framework for responsiveness
   - Explore image manipulation libraries for advanced artistic effects
