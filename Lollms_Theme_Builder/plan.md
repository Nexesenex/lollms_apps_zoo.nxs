# Lollms Theme Builder

## User Requirements
Create a web application that allows users to generate custom CSS themes for Lollms based on their descriptions. The app should include a sample CSS text, an input field for theme descriptions, and display the generated CSS code in a VSCode-like element with copy and save functionality.

## User Interface Elements
1. Header
   - App title: "Lollms Theme Builder"
   - Brief description of the app's purpose

2. Sample CSS Display
   - Read-only text area showing the sample CSS

3. Theme Description Input
   - Text area for users to input their theme descriptions

4. Generate Button
   - Triggers the CSS generation process

5. Output Display
   - VSCode-like element to display the generated CSS
   - Syntax highlighting for better readability

6. Action Buttons
   - Copy button: Copies the generated CSS to clipboard
   - Save button: Allows saving the CSS as a file

7. Footer
   - Credits and version information

## Use Cases
1. View Sample CSS
   - User can read the sample CSS to understand the structure

2. Describe Custom Theme
   - User inputs their desired theme characteristics

3. Generate CSS
   - User clicks the generate button to create custom CSS

4. Review Generated CSS
   - User examines the output in the VSCode-like element

5. Copy CSS
   - User copies the generated CSS to clipboard

6. Save CSS

## Technical Considerations
- Single HTML file structure with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Use of a CSS parsing and generation library (e.g., css-parser)
- Implementation of a simple AI model or rule-based system for CSS generation
- Utilization of a syntax highlighting library for the VSCode-like element
- Browser's built-in clipboard API for the copy functionality
- File API for saving the generated CSS
