description: Lollms Theme Builder is a web application that allows users to create
  custom CSS themes based on their descriptions. Users can input a sample CSS code
  and provide a detailed description of the desired theme. The application utilizes
  the Monaco Editor for a rich coding experience and generates the corresponding CSS
  code based on the user's input. The generated CSS can be easily copied to the clipboard
  or saved as a file, making it a convenient tool for developers and designers looking
  to streamline their theme creation process.
